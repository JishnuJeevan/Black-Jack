Blackjack is a game of chance.
This project was created by Kiran Raj (roll number 27) and Jishnu Jeevan (roll number 26)
of class XII-A of Kendriya Vidhyalaya Ernakulam,
batch Computer Science (year 2013-2014) in the year 2013
as an investigatory project for class XII. 
I, Jishnu Jeevan would like to thank Kiran for his idea for the Blackjack, our computer
science teacher Mrs. Radha Mohan for her support and her
guidance and also our friend Jhones Chakalakal of
class XII-C even though he was not a part of this
project for teaching us how the data fille handling
concept can be implemented in this game.
Thank you all for your support and your guidance.#
